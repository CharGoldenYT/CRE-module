# Char's Rhythm Engine (CRE) | HaxeFlixel Source Module (NOT a haxelib.)

a rhythm game engine developed by me, Char for the game, "Char's Adventure" (Working Title) but may be turned into a free standalone Funkin' like engine.

> [!NOTE]
> This version of it's source code is meant to purely be used as a module, and as such does NOT contain any assets (besides in game ones that are kinda needed to make it look good but not neccassary.), and does not contain any code besides those required to run it. making it extremely barebones to use.
> Any assets used for it should go under `assets/cre/` for instance to add an image via the images folder put it in `assets/cre/images/` in fact, there are already included assets with this repo that is for you to reference.

Refer to [libraries.xml](libraries.xml) for what libraries are needed for this project (Please open an issue if this is innacurate.) and [INCLUDING.md](INCLUDING.md) for how to include this as a module.
